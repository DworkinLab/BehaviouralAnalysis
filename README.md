BehaviouralAnalysis
===================

A repository outlingin statistical techniques for behavioural data (in particular for sequential data)


## Why is this here
I am writing this as I am finding that the state of analysis for sequential data is a bit muddled. Lots of techniques are used, many are related to one another, and are likely to generate similar results. Here I (with the help of other folks) will put in some details, and references, and then an example script.
